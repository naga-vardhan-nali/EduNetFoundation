Steps that i have Applied :
1.Transform Data that we need.
2.select table view and make use of view coloum quality.
3.Remove all errors and make them apply and continue and data is ready to use.
4.next step is to use data visualization tools that are provided in power BI.
NOTE:- I had removed the unusefull coloms like 1.customer name 2.customer id 
     - these coloms mey be care sensitive as the contain personal detains as their name.
