Steps that i have Applied :
1.we have to be selective in taking attributes like sales and profit and many more atteibutes that are reuuired for the dashbords preparation.
2.Select all the required fields and find the relation between them using the tools that are available to use in power BI dashBoards and make them efficient use of it.
3.Fix the two attributes as the main fields as x -Axis and y-Axis 
  -For example use sales as x-Axis and profit as y-Axis this will gives us the data of what
   amount we get in return after all the making charges and as meny more.
4.Like wise use all fields the you think as useful for your thinking and satesfies your targets use that data and built your insights.
5.Mostly use of less complicated one rather going to take complicated structures as they cannot be understandable by the stackholders as well as the people.
6.Use of simple cards like 1.Pichat 2.Bar Graphs 3.Number Cards 4.Gauge they can be easily convaying factor for all.
